## [About collaboration in a personal repository](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository#about-collaboration-in-a-personal-repository)

To collaborate with users in a repository that belongs to your personal account on GitHub, you can invite the users as collaborators.

If you want to grant more granular access to the repository, you can create a repository within an organization. For more information, see "[Access permissions on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/get-started/learning-about-github/access-permissions-on-github)."

Private forks inherit the permissions structure of the upstream repository. This helps owners of private repositories maintain control over their code. For example, if the upstream repository is private and gives read/write access to a team, then the same team will have read/write access to any forks of the private upstream repository. Only team permissions (not individual permissions) are inherited by private forks.

**Note:** When you change base permissions for an organization, permissions for private forks are not automatically updated. For more information, see "[Setting base permissions for an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.10/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/setting-base-permissions-for-an-organization#about-base-permissions-for-an-organization)."
